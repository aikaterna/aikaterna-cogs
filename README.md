# aikaterna-cogs
v3 Cogs for Red-DiscordBot by Twentysix26.

adventure - Originally by Locastan. My version is a collaboration between TrustyJAID, Draper, and myself. The repo can be found on my repo page here on github.

antiphoneclapper - Detects and removes bad GIFs posted in chat that have malformed frames. Thanks to Sitryk for all of the code that actually mattered for detection in this cog. Config stuff tacked on by me. Later iterations will include emoji recognizing and possibly link detection for these bad images.

away - Originally by Paddo, written for v3 by Axas, final tests by aikaterna, and large improvements by TrustyJAID. Set and unset a user as being "away".

blurplefy - Make an avatar or an image upload blurple for Discord's 3rd anniversary.

cah - Cards Against Humanity, played in DM's. This can rate limit large bots via the sheer number of messages sent. Install and use with caution on larger bots.

chatchart - Generates a pie chart to display chat activity over the last 5000 messages. Requested by violetnyte.

dadjokes - Another UltimatePancake cog. Get some dad jokes on command.

dictonary - I stole this from UltimatePancake's v2 cogs, defines words via a dictonary. Only the "define" command for now until the dependency owner updates their files with a pending PR.

dungeon - New users with new accounts will be shuffled off to a locked channel on-join to help mitigate raiders. Please see the dungeon_readme.md file on this repo for more information.

hunting - A long overdue port of Paddo's v2 hunting game to v3.

icyparser - Show icecast/shoutcast stream information. An audio addon cog to show the current stream info, or provide a url yourself.

imgwelcome - The repo can be found at: https://github.com/aikaterna/imgwelcome

inspirobot - Fetch "inspirational" messages from inspirobot.me with [p]inspireme.

noflippedtables - A v3 port of irdumb's v2 cog with a little extra surprise included. Unflip all the tables.

nolinks - A very blunt hammer to remove anything that looks like a link. Roles can be whitelisted and it can watch multiple channels.

otherbot - Alert a role when bot(s) go offline.

partycrash - A port of Will's partycrash command from the v2 Admin cog. This cog will not generate invites, but will show already-existing invites that the bot has access to view.

pingtime - Show all shards' pingtimes.

pressf - A port/rewrite of NekoTony's v2 pressf cog. Pay your respects by pressing F.

pupper - A cog for Ryan5374. A pet that comes around on an on_message listener and waits for someone to pet it (react with a standard wave emoji), and rewards with credits. Many attributes are configurable.

quiz - A kahoot-like trivia game. Originally by Keane for Red v2.

region - A command to change the voice region of a server. Requires the guild admin or mod role or guild administrator.

retrosign - A v3 port of Anismash's retrosign cog.

rndstatus - A v3 port of Twentysix's rndstatus cog with a couple extra settings.

snacktime - A v3 port of irdumb's snacktime cog. Now with friends!

timezone - A v3 port of Fishyfing's timezone cog with a few improvements.

trickortreat - A trick or treat-based competitive candy eating game with a leaderboard and other fun commands like stealing candy from guildmates.

tools - A collection of mod and admin tools, ported from my v2 version. Sitryk is responsible for a lot of the code in tools... thanks for the help with this cog.

warcraftlogs - Fetch player info/metrics from the WarcraftLogs API for World of Warcraft Classic. Does not provide stats for non-Classic characters.

wolfram - A v3 port of Paddo's abandoned Wolfram Alpha cog.

youtube - A v3 port of Paddo's youtube search cog for v2.

Support for these cogs is via opened issues on the appropriate repo or in the Red - Cog Support server.
