v3 Cogs for Red-DiscordBot by Twentysix26.

adventure - Original concept & cog by locastan. My version is a collaboration between TrustyJAID, Draper, and myself and is now markedly different than locastan's version. The repo can be found on my repo page here on github.

antiphoneclapper - Detects and removes bad GIFs posted in chat that have malformed frames. Thanks to Sitryk for all of the code that actually mattered for detection in this cog.

away - Originally by Paddo, written for v3 by Axas, final tests by aikaterna, and large improvements by TrustyJAID. Set and unset a user as being "away", or other statuses.

blurplefy - Make an avatar or an image upload blurple for Discord's anniversaries.

cah - Cards Against Humanity, played in DM's. This can rate limit large bots via the sheer number of messages sent. Install and use with caution on larger bots.
