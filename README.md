v3 Cogs for Red-DiscordBot by Twentysix26.

adventure - Original concept & cog by locastan. My version is a collaboration between TrustyJAID, Draper, and myself and is now markedly different than locastan's version. The repo can be found on my repo page here on github.

antiphoneclapper - Detects and removes bad GIFs posted in chat that have malformed frames. Thanks to Sitryk for all of the code that actually mattered for detection in this cog.

away - Originally by Paddo, written for v3 by Axas, final tests by aikaterna, and large improvements by TrustyJAID. Set and unset a user as being "away", or other statuses.

blurplefy - Make an avatar or an image upload blurple for Discord's anniversaries.

cah - Cards Against Humanity, played in DM's. This can rate limit large bots via the sheer number of messages sent. Install and use with caution on larger bots.

chatchart - Generates a pie chart to display chat activity over the last 5000 messages. Requested by violetnyte.

dadjokes - Another UltimatePancake cog. Get some dad jokes on command.

dictonary - Define words and look up antonyms and synonyms. Originally by UltimatePancake.

dungeon - New users with new accounts will be shuffled off to a locked channel on-join to help mitigate raiders. Please see the [dungeon_readme.md](https://github.com/aikaterna/aikaterna-cogs/blob/v3/dungeon_readme.md) file on this repo for more information.

hunting - A long overdue port of Paddo's v2 hunting game to v3.

icyparser - Show icecast/shoutcast stream information. An audio addon cog to show the current stream info, or provide a url yourself.

imgwelcome - Welcome users to your server(s) with an image. The repo can be found on my repo page here on github.

inspirobot - Fetch "inspirational" messages from inspirobot.me with [p]inspireme.

invites - Display invites that are available on the server and the information those invites contain. The bot must have the administrator permission granted on the guild to be able to use this cog.

noflippedtables - A v3 port of irdumb's v2 cog with a little extra surprise included. Unflip all the tables.

pressf - A port/rewrite of NekoTony's v2 pressf cog. Pay your respects by pressing F.

pupper - A cog for Ryan5374. A pet that comes around on an on_message listener and waits for someone to pet it (react with a standard wave emoji), and rewards with credits. Many attributes are configurable.

quiz - A kahoot-like trivia game. Originally by Keane for Red v2.

region - A command to change the voice region of a server. Requires the guild admin or mod role or guild administrator.
